                <li>1 medium sized cinnamon stick</li>
                <li>3tsp coriander powder</li>
                <li>1tsp cumin powder</li>
                <li>1tsp red chilli powder</li>
                <li>1-2tsp salt (to taste)</li>
                <li>Kewra water, 1tsp or more as per preference</li>
                <li>20 almonds, skins removed</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="header title">Instructions</h3>
        <div class="box">
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Heat the oil/ghee in a deep pot or pan. Add the sliced onions and fry them over a medium to high heat, stirring often and keeping a very close eye on them to ensure they brown evenly. You may find you need to turn the heat down after a while if they look like they may be browning too quickly/unevenly.</li>
                <li>Once the onions have turned a dark brown (not black!), use a slotted spoon to remove them and rest them spread out on a paper towel. Set aside - these will crisp up as we work on the korma</li>
                <li>Add the chicken, spices, ginger and garlic to the oil in the pan. Fry this over a medium to high heat, until the chicken no longer remains pink</li>
                <li>Add in the yogurt and cashews paste. Fry everything well, stirring the entire time, until the oil begins to separate from the sauce of the curry and looks glossy.</li>
                <li>Add in 400ml of water, bring everything to a boil and then cover with a lid and cook on a low heat for about 30 minutes</li>
                <li>As the korma cooks, once the onions have cooled down completely and become crisp, you can crush them using your hands or a pestle and mortar until they are broken down into a textured mixture. Don't crush them into a fine powder or paste.</li>
                <li>Take the lid off and stir in the onions. Return the lid and cook for a further 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add in the kewra water. Give everything a taste and adjust the chilli and salt if needed</li>
                <li>Garnish with almonds just before serving</li>
            </ol>
